Introduction to the Program:

DON'T FORGET TO PUSH THE NEW FOLDER TO GITHUB

Stage 1. Examine the output of the program
1.) Download the program from github or WETRANSFER

2.) Extract the program
	(might need 7zip)

3.) Look over already made itineraries in the itineraries folder
	Specifically note that Etape Commune 2 is unfinished, but that
	we will load a file that will finish it when I show how to load and generate
	PDF files.

4.) Explain the difference between the itineraries and itineraries in progress folders

Stage 2. Running the Program

1.) Install python 3.7
	https://www.python.org/
	Hover over downloads
	Click [Python 3.7]
	Ensure that python.exe is added to the system path

2.) Navigate to the directory that the program was extracted to

3.) Launch by clicking on the 'itinerary creator' shortcut (feel free to drag this to your desktop)
	It has the ACM icon

4.) After the program launches, click the 'itineraire de chargement' (load itinerary)

5.) Load ETAPE COMMUNE 2
	Notice how it is unfinished
	Explain that I have already been working on finishing that one, and that I sent the finished
	'loadable' file with the program.
	Load
